* OS6128_BASIC1-1_AMSDOS_MAXAM : important evolve dsk and ROMs about anti-regression for this project.
* firmware_CRC16 : outdated fork of firmware about adding CRC16 in SDCARD, invalidated in main fork SDCARD does not need it. I put that here because for dev purpose it can be usefull (but not for performance/end version)
* DOC : simple end user manual (fr)
* VirtualNet96 : backup of http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Virtual_Net_96 referenced very old website
